Code As Manuscript student material
===================================

This folder and all its child folders (collectively known as a git
repository, or repo) is where we place all our material and resources
that students can and/or will use for our workshops.

Each folder (known also as directories) contains the material for a
certain workshop.  For example, the `git` folder contains the
cheatsheets and other material for the git workshop/session.
